MSc Financial Engineering Capstone Project for Group 7121 
This is a repository for WQU Financial Engineering Capstone project artifacts. 
A three member team is engaged in delivering this project.The team will work on Topic 1: Swing Trading. This research seeks to create and analyze successful swing trading techniques suited to the Indian stock market. By targeting index-based equities, particularly those in the NIFTY50 and NIFTYNEXT50, the team intends to take advantage of the high liquidity and market depth offered within such securities. To maximize strategy performance, experiments will be conducted using various technical indicators, fundamental analytical methodologies, and risk management approaches. Reliable backtesting methods will be implemented for an accurate evaluation and to reduce bias. The team will also devise trading system rules for one of the swing trading scenarios documented in goals sections of the topic write-up.
Through this research, we gain:  
●		An understanding of the variables that influence the success of swing trading methods in India.
●		A possible groundwork for further algorithmic trading study and development.
We will use the Yahoo Finance (yFinance) package in python as the data source for OHLC of the individual stocks in the mentioned indices. The team will rely on technical indicators to identify entry and exit points to end up with successful trades.
